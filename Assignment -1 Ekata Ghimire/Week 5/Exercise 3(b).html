   Web design refers to the design of websites that are displayed 
   on the internet. It usually refers to the user experience aspects
   of website development rather than software development. Web 
   design used to be focused on designing websites for desktop 
   browsers; however, since the mid-2010s, design for mobile and
   tablet browsers has become ever-increasingly important.
